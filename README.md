# NodeJS Demo App

This project is a simple Node.js application created to practice and demonstrate Git version control and branching workflows.

## What We Did

- Initialized a Git repository and pushed the code to GitHub.
- Created multiple branches:
  - `main` — The production-ready code.
  - `dev` — Development branch for testing new features.
  - `feature/add-about-page` — Feature branch where we added a new "About" page route.
- Made code changes on the feature branch (`feature/add-about-page`) by adding a new route.
- Committed and pushed changes to the feature branch.
- Created a Pull Request (PR) to merge the feature branch into the `dev` branch.
- Reviewed and merged the feature branch into `dev`.
- Tested and verified the `dev` branch.
- Created a PR to merge `dev` into `main`.
- Merged `dev` into `main` to release the updated code.
- Deleted the feature branch after successful merge.
- Used proper commit messages and Git best practices throughout the workflow.

## Project Structure

- `index.js` — Main application file with routes for Home and About pages.

## Summary
This project helped me understand how to use Git branches, make pull requests, and merge feature branches into development and main branches in a real-world workflow. It demonstrates the power of version control for collaborative software development.
